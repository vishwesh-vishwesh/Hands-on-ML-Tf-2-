# Hands-on-ML-Tf-2-
Execution of codes from Hands on ML by Aurelien Geron
Codes are executed chapter wise from the book
Each code is split in cells and multiple codes/methods to solve the same problem may exist in the single .py file
Suggested to to run the code cell by cell and examine what is happening would be a good idea to check these codes
